# Bryn Mawr College and the M. Carey Thomas Controversy

## As a Bryn Mawr College alumna, I have been closely following my alma mater’s reexamination of how it should recognize the history and contribution of one of its past presidents, M. Carey Thomas. Having led the college from 1894 to 1922, Thomas was a leading suffragist and an avid promoter of women’s education. As part of past efforts to recognize her contribution to the college and women’s education, in general, the college named its central auditorium and one of its libraries after Thomas—Thomas Great Hall and Thomas Library, respectively. Over the course of this past academic year, however, many members of the Bryn Mawr College community have called into question this recognition because of Thomas’ known and documented racist and bigoted views. This is, of course, part of a larger trend across the country, with many colleges and universities asking tough questions about how certain forms of recognition may conflict with espoused values.

Because I am a member of Bryn Mawr College’s D.C. alumnae group, as well as a volunteer for The Lantern Bookshop (which is mostly staffed by Bryn Mawr alumnae and has a close association with the college), I have observed and participated in many conversations about this subject over the last year. As one would expect with a subject this potentially divisive, the opinions on the subject span a range of views. While some believe Thomas’ openly racist and anti-Semitic views, and advancement of discriminatory policies, means that the buildings should be re-named, others believe that doing so is tantamount to erasing history and diminishing her promotion of women’s education and contribution to the college. I received an email only last week notifying the college community that the working group that had been formed to address this issue has concluded their analysis and put forward recommendations, which is why I decided to collect data about this subject. Many are dissatisfied with the recommendations, which are nuanced and thoughtful, and the central issue appears to be the following: the college will no longer refer to the main hall or library with the use of “Thomas” in the daily business of the college but it will not remove her name from the building, itself.
